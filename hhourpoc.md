### H-Hour POC

In 2013 I was brought on as a junior programmer at SOF Studios, headed by David Sears, for the creation of a proof of concept for the game H-Hour: World’s Elite. H-Hour was crowd-funded on Kickstarter.com to create a proof of concept that could be pitched to venture capitalists. The Kickstarter raised $250,000. The proof of concept was developed using Unreal Engine 3.
 
H-Hour: World’s Elite is a spiritual successor to SOCOM: U.S. Navy Seals. It is a third-person tactical shooter that focuses on teamwork and counter-terrorist operations. As junior programmer, my contributions to the proof of concept were many. I handled all the UI programming in Actionscript 3. I also worked on weapons and ballistics. I created tools for designers to tweak the variables for weapons. I created the game mode round logic that would handle winning, re-setting the level after the round ended, going from the game back to the lobby, etc. 
 
This proof of concept led toward funding for H-Hour: World’s Elite for Steam on the PC.
